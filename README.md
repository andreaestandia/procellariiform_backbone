# Substitution Rate Variation in a Robust Procellariiform Seabird Phylogeny is not Solely Explained by Body Mass, Flight Efficiency, Population Size or Life History Traits

This GitHub repository contains supplementary material and custom scripts used in the manuscript: Substitution Rate Variation in a Robust Procellariiform Seabird Phylogeny is not Solely Explained by Body Mass, Flight Efficiency, Population Size or Life History Traits (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.27.453752v1)

### Scripts:

1. `0_uce_processing` is the first step in the analysis that will take you from raw data to the final alignments
2. In `1_phylogenetics` you can find the main scripts to reproduce the phylogenetic analyses
3. `2_correlation` contains the COEVOL 1.4b scripts to explore the correlations between substitution rate and different variables

In the folder `R` you can find scripts for reproducing some figures and running the `Phylogenetic path` analysis

### Supplementary material:

* `supplementary_info.pdf` has information about the fossil calibrations and supplementary figures

* `supplementary_tables.xlxs` has Tables S1-S10

### Data access:

All raw sequence data are archived on GenBank under the accession number PRJNA749710.
