# Body Size, Population Size and Life History Traits Explain Little Substitution Rate Variation in a Robust Procellariiform Seabird Phylogeny

This GitHub repository contains supplementary material and custom scripts used in the manuscript: Body Size, Population Size and Life History Traits Explain Little Substitution Rate Variation in a Robust Procellariiform Seabird Phylogeny

### Scripts:

1. `0_uce_processing` is the first step in the analysis that will take you from raw data to the final alignments
2. In `1_phylogenetics` you can find the main scripts to reproduce the phylogenetic analyses
3. `2_correlation` contains the COEVOL 1.4b scripts to explore the correlations between substitution rate and different variables

### Supplementary material:

* supplementary_info.pdf has information about the fossil calibrations and supplementary figures

* `supplementary_tables.xlxs` has Tables S1-S10

### Data access:

Raw data from this study have been submitted to [NNNN]
