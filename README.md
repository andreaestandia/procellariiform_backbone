# Correlates of Substitution Rate Variation in a Robust Procellariiform Seabird Phylogeny 

This GitHub repository contains supplementary material and custom scripts used in the manuscript: Correlated of Substitution Rate Variation in a Robust Procellariiform Seabird Phylogeny

Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.27.453752v1

### Scripts:

1. `0_uce_processing` is the first step in the analysis that will take you from raw data to the final alignments
2. In `1_phylogenetics` you can find the main scripts to reproduce the phylogenetic analyses
3. `2_correlation` contains the COEVOL 1.4b scripts to explore the correlations between substitution rate and different variables

In the folder `R` you can find scripts for reproducing some figures and running the `Phylogenetic path` analysis

### Supplementary material:

* `2_supplementary_material.docx` has information about the fossil calibrations and supplementary figures

* `1_supplementary_tables.xlxs` has Tables S1-S10

### Data access:

All raw sequence data are archived on GenBank under the accession number PRJNA749710.
